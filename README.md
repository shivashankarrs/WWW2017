# WWW2017

Updates till now:

1. I have signed the e-copyright form and received the DOI
2. Updated .tex files to include copyright details
3. Included author names and affiliation (made some changes to custom style, to make it fit in 2 pages still) //Not sure if that is the best way/looks good or not.

W.r.t the reviewer comments, key pointers (according to me) are as follows

1. Readability
2. Language
3. Experimental settings and results of supervised upper-bound (this part is already included in the paper)

Important files in the folder are:

1. WWW2017.tex (main tex file)
2. WWWComments.txt (this includes reviewer comments)
